# Hello-2018
Hello! This project I writted on 2017 and last commit has been comitted on Dec 2017. At that time my ะก++ knowledge was bad and the code style was bullshit. I've learned a lot since then and I decide write a new project. And it project is a kiero.

Kiero the universal graphical hook for D3D9-D3D12, OpenGL and Vulcan.
This project you can find in [this github repository](https://github.com/Rebzzel/kiero).

Universal-D3D11-Hook will get the latest "Hello 2018" update and no longer supported or updated. 

Thank you very much for your stars, it realy motivated me.
